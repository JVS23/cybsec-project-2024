After cloning the project into your chosen directory,
you can start the project with the following command:

``` 
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Depending on your configuration, you might need to use the command "py", or "python" instead of "python3".

The application is a simple Todo-app, which serves as a way to showcase different security flaws. In the section below we'll be assessing the implementations of these security flaws, and also their solutions.

You need to log in to access user-specific Todo-lists.
Here are test users and passwords for the application:

| Name        | Password    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| tester1     | Mooc2024    |
| tester2     | Mooc2024    |
